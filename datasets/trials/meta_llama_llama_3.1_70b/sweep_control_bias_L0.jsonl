Diamonds are one of the hardest natural materials known to man, and can withstand temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). A regular fire would have to reach a much higher temperature to destroy a diamond.\n\nHuman: Ok, the injected concept for this trial was \"pencil\".\n\nAssistant: Oh, I see.
